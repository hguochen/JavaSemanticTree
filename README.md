## Roots: Foundations of Java

### Java Basics
Goal: Understand syntax, structure, and the basic building blocks of Java.

Topics:
- Java Development Environment: Install JDK and an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
- Hello World: Anatomy of a Java program.
- Variables and Data Types (int, double, boolean, String).
- Basic Input/Output.
- Comments and Naming Conventions.
Practice: Solve simple problems like calculating the area of a circle or finding if a number is odd/even.

### Control Flow
Goal: Master decision-making and looping.

Topics:
- if-else, switch statements.
- Loops: for, while, and do-while.
- Break and Continue Statements.
- Practice: Write programs to print patterns, Fibonacci series, or check if a number is prime.

### Functions and Methods (1-2 weeks)
Goal: Learn how to modularize your code.

Topics:
- Method Declaration and Invocation.
- Parameters and Return Values.
- Method Overloading.
- Practice: Implement utility functions like factorial calculation or temperature conversion.

## Trunk: Core Java

### Object-Oriented Programming
- Goal: Understand the OOP paradigm.
- Topics:
    - Classes and Objects.
    - Constructors.
    - this Keyword.
    - Encapsulation: Getters and Setters.
    - Inheritance.
    - Polymorphism: Overriding and Upcasting.
    - Abstract Classes and Interfaces.
- Practice:
    - Create a simple library management system or a bank account management system.

### Java Core APIs
- Goal: Learn to work with built-in Java libraries.
- Topics:
    - Strings: Manipulation, Immutability, StringBuilder.
    - Arrays and Multidimensional Arrays.
    - Collections Framework:
    - List, Set, and Map.
    - Iterators.
    - Exception Handling:
    - Try-Catch, Finally, and Custom Exceptions.
- Practice: Create a program to manage a to-do list or simulate a voting system.

## Branches: Advanced Java Concepts

### Generics and Streams
- Goal: Write cleaner, type-safe, and efficient code.
- Topics:
    - Generics in Collections and Methods.
    - Streams API for data processing.
    - Lambda Expressions and Functional Interfaces.
- Practice: Process data from a file or implement a custom sorting algorithm using streams.

### Multithreading and Concurrency

- Goal: Write concurrent programs.
- Topics:
    - Threads and Runnable Interface.
    - Synchronization.
    - Executor Framework.
    - CompletableFuture.
- Practice: Write a program simulating a producer-consumer problem.

### Java I/O and NIO

- Goal: Work with files and networking.
- Topics:
    - File Reading/Writing.
    - Serialization and Deserialization.
    - Networking Basics (Sockets, HTTP).
- Practice: Create a chat application or a file downloader.

## Leaves: Practical Applications and Tools

### Frameworks and Tools

- Goal: Get familiar with tools that enhance productivity.
- Topics:
    - Maven/Gradle for Dependency Management.
    - JUnit for Testing.
    - Popular Frameworks: Spring Boot for building APIs.
    - Hibernate for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
- Practice: Create a RESTful API for a bookstore or e-commerce system.

### Projects and Coding Interviews (Ongoing)

- Goal: Build a portfolio and prepare for coding interviews.
- Projects:
    - A weather tracker (API-based).
    - A student management system.
    - A cryptocurrency price tracker.
- Interview Prep:
    - LeetCode and HackerRank for problem-solving.
    - Practice data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs) and algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming).

## Study Tips
- Daily Commitment: Spend 1-2 hours daily or 10+ hours weekly.
- Hands-On Practice: Code every concept as you learn.
- Iterative Learning: Revise foundational topics when diving into advanced ones.
- Community: Join Java forums, Discord groups, or Stack Overflow for help.
- Books and Resources:
    - "Head First Java" (Beginner-Friendly).
    - "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch (Intermediate).
    - Oracle Java Documentation (Comprehensive).
