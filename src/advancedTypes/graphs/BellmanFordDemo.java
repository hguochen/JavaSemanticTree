/**
 * Bellman Ford algorithm is a method used in graph theory for finding the shortest path between a single source vertex
 * and all other vertices in a weighted graph.
 *
 * This algorithm can handle graphs with negative weight edges, unlike dijkstra's algorithm.
 *
 * It follows a bottom-up approach, filling up the distance table gradually while relaxing edges.
 *
 * Why use Bellman-Ford?
 * - Handles negative weights, Dijkstra's does not
 * - Detects negative cycles, Dijkstra's does not
 * - Has complexity O(V X E)
 * - Works on both directed and undirected graphs
 *
 * When to use it?
 * - graph has edges with negative weights
 * - need to detect negative cycles
 * - can tolerate increased time complexity(O(V * E))
